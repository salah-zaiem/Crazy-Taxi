# Reinforcement Learning Agent for Crazy Taxi
We built from scratch the Crazy Taxi environment and  three learning agents using three different Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

## Getting Started 


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Prerequisites 
Basic Python 3 libraries and and tkinter for visualisation. 
## Reward  
The agent has two positive rewards : Staying alive at each turn and getting the coins that appear randomly in empty spaces. Getting a coin brings much more reward than just staying alive. 

 
## Instructions 


There are two different codes :

-Crazy taxi without interface : our work without the animation of the environment and the agent

-Crazy taxi with interface : our work with the animation of the environment and the agent

Normally, the animation in the last code works on all type of systems. If it not the case on your computer, just run the one without the interface, and we invite you to refer you to the report for a screen of our environment and agent.

Important : In order to make the animation work, you juste have to run the concerned cell for sarsa, qlearning and qlearning back prop in the Jupyter Notebook. After a short time, an animated window will appear on your screen. DO NOT close it when it ends, just wait for the cell of the Jupyter Notebook to finish, and run the next cells in the Jupyter Notebook. 
Once you arrive at the end of the code, you just have to close jupyter in order to close the windows created with tkinter. 
## Algorithms 
Three different algorithms are presented after building the environment. Sarsa, Q learning and a custom one we called q learning back prop that is giving the best results.
